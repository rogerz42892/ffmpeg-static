1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,730
SPEAKER 1: Now that you've initialized
the board and that you've drawn it,

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,880
it's time to let the user edit
it and make their moves.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,400
So in the 15.c function, the program
takes input from the user and then

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,400
calls the Move function, passing in the
number of the tile that the user

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,660
wants to move.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,790
Now, be careful.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,580
This is the actual number of the tile
and not its actual position.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,410
So you'll need to search for the tile's
position to know where it is.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,820
Now, you should only allow the user
to make a move if it's legal.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,300
A legal move is any tile that is
adjacent to the blank tile.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,400
That means above and below, to
the left, and to the right.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,070
So you'll need to know where
the blank tile is as well.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,420
Now, for every move, you're searching
for the user's tile.

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,580
But it's probably not best to search for
the blank tile every time, because

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,660
you're doing it every single time
the user wants to move.

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,730
So instead, it's best to remember where
the blank tile is, using some

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,050
well-named variables.

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,360
So once you allow the user to make their
moves, they are well on their

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,290
way to winning the game of 15.

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,613
